# CTC13
Parent Repo for the Code the City 13 Alcohol Hack weekend.

We had three teams working on the same number of principal projects:

## Cantcha
[Cantcha project](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/cantcha) - how likely is it that someone will correctly identify whether a drink is alcoholic or non-alcoholic? Can AI and Machine learning help us?

## Recovery Squirrels
[Recovery Squirrels](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/recoverysquirrel) - how can we support those in recovery? Could a voluntary code be created and adopted, which would provide a common way of understanding what services are available which meets those standards?

## Mocktails Awards
Team Mindfulness ran a project looking at how safe and comfortable alcohol-free spaces could be brought about through producing high quality Mocktails, which led to the [Mocktails Awards](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/mocktailsawards)
