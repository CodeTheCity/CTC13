# CTC13
Parent Repo for the Code the City 13 Alcohol Hack weekend.

So far we have two projects / teams:

## Cantcha
[https://github.com/CodeTheCity/cantcha](Cantcha project) - how likely is it that someone will correctly identify whether a drink is alcoholic or non-alcoholic

## Recovery Squirrels
[https://github.com/CodeTheCity/recoverysquirrel[(Recovery Squirrels) - how can we support those in recovery?
